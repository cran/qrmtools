- make sure Alex is mentioned as author
- Make new release as soon as 'plot.xts' changes (see Josh's email from
  2017-04-05 (josh.m.ulrich@gmail.com))
- Implement ES_bound_hom() for best ES in the homogeneous case

### (A)RA
- Maybe write do.call(cbind()) and .rowSums(do.call(cbind())) as C functions
  to further speed-up rearrange()
- If one can fix rearrange() to work with Inf quantiles, maybe make rearrange()
  have already lists as inputs (replace sapply() by lapply() in RA() and ARA()
  to build the list of columns)
  => doesn't seem easy, see code

### Composite distributions (see Kurt's email, Sep. 25)
- Build objects:
  composite(distr, breaks, weights) sollte ein composite distribution function
  objekt x konstruieren und man kann dann pcomposite(q, x), qcomposite(p, x) und
  rcomposite(n, x) damit machen.
- Use 'breaks' as argument (passed on to cut())
